## 📊 Project Overview

This notebook analyzes a dataset of online products to answer key questions like:
- What pricing patterns exist across products?
- How do discounts relate to actual and selling prices?
- How do ratings and rating counts vary across products?

The analysis involved extensive data cleaning, type correction, feature extraction, and visualizations to support data-driven insights.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numeric computations  
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** – Visualizations and EDA

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Cleaned product prices by removing currency symbols and converting to numeric types.
- Calculated and standardized **discount percentages** for accurate comparisons.
- Removed missing and duplicate entries, and handled data anomalies like invalid rating formats.
- Visualized trends in **ratings**, **price vs. discount**, and **rating counts** to extract actionable insights.
